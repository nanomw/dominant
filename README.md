# Доминанта

Вторая нота, которую мы изучим, называется `Доминанта`.
You remember that in order to get the `Tonic` one octave higher from the original string we had to shorted the length of the string by half.
To get the `Dominant` we must shorten the string by one third of its length. When a string is shortened by one third its frequency increases by half. If it was 100 it becomes 150.
This distance when one note is 1.5 times more frequent than another is called `Fifth`. There is a `Fifth` between `Tonic` and `Dominant`.

Another distance that we well learn on this level is between `Dominant` and upper `Tonic`. In this case the string is shortened by one quarter of its length. 
Frequency increases by one third. If it was 150 it becomes 200 (50 is one third of 150)
This interval is called `Forth`. There is a `Forth` between `Dominant` and upper `Tonic`.
